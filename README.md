# Overview

Welcome to my personal repository, where I showcase some of my favorite projects! It’s designed to highlight my skills, document my growth as a developer, and share my work with others. Feel free to explore and learn more about what I do. 👩🏻‍💻

# Development Environment

To build this portfolio, I'm using Visual Studio Code as my code editor. It offers great flexibility and has useful extensions to streamline the coding process. I also rely on Git for version control. I’m currently working with HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to add dynamic features.
